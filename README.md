# Installation
* Download the AddOn by clicking the "Download ZIP" button
* Extract the downloaded ZIP
* Rename the innermost folder (containing the AddOn files) to `KeyPressedReleasedMacroButton`
* Copy that folder into your **WoW\Interface\AddOns** folder

# Usage
Open core.lua in a text editor (one with Lua syntax highlighting is preferred, but not required) and change the macros at the top of the file (inside of `[==[` and `]==]`) to whatever you want to run when the key is pressed and released.

You can bind the key in-game through the default key bindings menu (under the AddOns category).
